## Description
In this project we tried  four modeling method Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Catboost classifier , we used dataset from  drivendata  to  finding patterns and regularities using data mining technique to predict H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines. dataset is available under drivendata as Feature data.

## Conclusions

We tried different methodologies to predict the results regarding the prediction of H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccines such as Random Forest Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Catboost classifier and we got a best score 0.8632 and rank 49 out of 2692 using Catboost classifier
